Description: The package is used to detect extended, diffuse and compact
             blemishes on microarray chips. Harshlight automatically marks
             the areas in a collection of chips (affybatch objects) and a
             corrected AffyBatch object is returned, in which the defected
             areas are substituted with NAs or the median of the values of
             the same probe in the other chips in the collection.
             The new version handle the substitute value as whole matrix
             to solve the memory problem.
